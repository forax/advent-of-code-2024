# advent-of-code-2024
Let's try to do the advent of code 2024 in Java 23

Like [last year](https://github.com/forax/advent-of-code-2023), i will only do the first part of each challenge in hope it wil not take too much time.
Unike last year, i will try to write the solution in "Beautiful Java" instead of code golfing a solution :) 

Each puzzle is contained in one file, by example for the day 1, you can just run
```bash
java src/main/java/AdventOfCode01.java
```

- [Day  1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) [AdventOfCode01.java](src/main/java/AdventOfCode01.java)

Each code will be published the day after.

Enjoy
